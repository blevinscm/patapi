## About PAT

This project is building a service that a PTSD sufferer can use to talk about their feelings and can receive data driven feedback for coping with PTSD. The service allows the customer to record their emotions, flashbacks, incidents, nightmares in a journal that they can then choose to share with their mental health professional. Being able to get the emotions and thoughts out with the added benefit of being able to share with their mental health provider will be of a great service. 

## Data Privacy 

All data collected is anonymized and used to provide coping feedback to the user.  Targeting of devices is done through an appID that is assigned when an account is created.  At no time does the Service collect or maintain any personal identifier information.
