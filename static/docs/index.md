## About PAT

The PAT project team is building a service that a PTSD sufferer can use to talk about their feelings, incidents, and traumatic experiences in a safe and private manner.  Users can receive data driven feedback for coping with PTSD based on their entries. The service allows the user to record a traumatic experience, general journal entry, or an incident with a PTSD specific conversational canvas.

## Data Privacy 

All data collected is anonymized and used to provide coping feedback to the user.  Targeting of devices is done through an appID that is assigned when an account is created.  At no time does the Service collect or maintain any personal identifier information.
